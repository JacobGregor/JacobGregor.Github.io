Documentation: https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js  

What is node.js? 

As stated by Node.js team: "Node.js is a Javascript runtime built on Chrome's V8 Javascript engine.

Stack Overflows example: "Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asychronous I/O runtime that uses Google's V8 Javascript engine and libuv library.

In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?  
Chromes V* Engine compiles our JS code into Machine code that our computer then knows how to execute based on. 

What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?  
-> We Use node on our computer side to execute JS code.

What is npm?  
-> Node PAckage Manager

What version of node are you running on your machine?  
-> v14.17.0

What version of npm are you running on your machine?  
-> 6.14.13

What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?  
-> npm install -g jshint

What is node used for?  
Many many functionalities:   
-> Bundling js dependencies  
-> running tests  
-> auto code linting  
-> running js on the server side!  


**Node.js is singlethreaded and event driven.**  
-> Node is there for non-blocking; if it encounters a blocking I/O it will initiate a callback before processing the event. When its done processing the first event it will trigger the callback to begin processing said event. ect..node

2.collaboration
3. learning
4. social skills
5. interview readiness
6. work environment ereadiness

In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
-> Navigating therough code and talking it out has greatly increased my understanding of how code works and how to "Think like a computer" when solving a problem.
How does pair programming work?
Driver & Navigator. Driver codes while the navigator talks through the user stories and tells the driver what to code while also being in charge of all documentation lookup.
