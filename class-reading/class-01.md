Author, pg. 21
> "HTML uses elements to describe the structure of pages"


## Topic: **Element Tags**

-> Tags are used as containers to house the content of our document. anything text within the following <p> </p> for example would be displayed as a paragraph in our web dociument.

-> WIthin an element tag we can also use **attributes**. These provide additional information about our element and the contents within. 
  Ex. Author, pg. 25
> <p lang="en-us"> this paragraph is in english </p> 
-> here the attribute is the "lang=en-us" which is specifying a language for the content of the <p>. 
  
### **Chapter Summary**
-> Key take aways are Tags (Elements) and their structure. <p> </p> tags come in pairs with an opening & cloding tag. 
  
 
## **Chapter 8 - "Extra Markup"**
  
## **Key Concepts**
  
Tags/Elements covered:
 - Comment Tag: !-- --> *Note: you will need < start tag in order for it to register as a comment tag, but i want it to be visible.. ha.
 - Block Eleements: alaways starts on a new line in the browser. 
 - Inline ELements: continue on the same line as their neighboring elements. 
 - div: Groups elements in one block-level box. div should be used to group sections of your web page. Think of div as a container whithin which to house other elements that make up the sections of your webpage. div are manipulated in CSS to adjust their attributes as they relate to the webpage.
 - span: span is best described as the inline version of a div. We can use span to manipulate specific content within elements.
 - Escape Characters: These are the code references for how we use reserved characters. Reference pg 193-194 for a list of escape code references. 
  
Class vs. ID Attributes
-> HTML elements can carry an ID & Class attribute. This allows for specific ID's or classes to be called in CSS to manipulate a specific element by ID or elements by a designated class. **ID is used for specific single element designations while class allows for several elements top be identified and manipulated.**
  
### **Chapter Summary**
  - div & span tags and how we use them within our structure to create containers either in-block or inline. (pg. 187-188)
  - iframe tags allow you to cut windows into your webpage. Think google map squares cut into websites to show a snapshot location. 
  - meta allow you to supply information about the website used behind the scenes to dictate characteristics for your website.
